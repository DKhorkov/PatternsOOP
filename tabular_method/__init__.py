"""
The tabular method is a pattern for constructing a program that helps make it flexible and avoid branching
(many constructions of if-else conditional statements), including when they could be duplicated in several places.

Instead of creating a new branch, it simply adds an entry to the table without having to change the rest of the program.
The prerequisite for this is working through the interface.
