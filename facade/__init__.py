"""
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simple interface to a complex class system, library, or framework.

Facade is a simple interface for working with a complex subsystem containing many classes.
Facade may have a stripped-down interface that does not have 100% of the functionality that can be achieved by
using a complex subsystem directly. But it provides exactly those features that the client needs and hides all the rest.

Facade is useful if client using some complex library with a lot of moving parts,
but needs only part of its capabilities.
