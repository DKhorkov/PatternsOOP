The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern, which divides abstraction from implementation by creating
two separated hierarchies.

A change in functionality in one hierarchy does not entail changes in another.

In current example can use different car abstractions (Jeep or Truck) with different
implementations (Gasoline or Diesel).
