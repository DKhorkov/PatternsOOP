Mixin classes are a concept in programming in which a class provides functionality,
but is not intended to be used on its own.

The main purpose of mixins is to provide some additional methods without binding to a specific type of objects.

For example, to provide method calculate_area() to both classes Rectangle and Field, mixin class can be used,
so that there is no hard coding of a method into each of these classes.
